HTML version by Al Haines.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax\\n\\n\\nBy\\n\\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But why Turkish?\" asked Mr. Sherlock Holmes, gazing fixedly at my\\nboots.  I was reclining in a cane-backed chair at the moment, and my\\nprotruded feet had attracted his ever-active attention.\\n\\n\"English,\" I answered in some surprise.  \"I got them at Latimer\\'s, in\\nOxford Street.\"\\n\\nHolmes smiled with an expression of weary patience.\\n\\n\"The bath!\" he said; \"the bath!  Why the relaxing and expensive Turkish\\nrather than the invigorating home-made article?\"\\n\\n\"Because for the last few days I have been feeling rheumatic and old. A\\nTurkish bath is what we call an alterative in medicine--a fresh\\nstarting-point, a cleanser of the system.\\n\\n\"By the way, Holmes,\" I added, \"I have no doubt the connection between\\nmy boots and a Turkish bath is a perfectly self-evident one to a\\nlogical mind, and yet I should be obliged to you if you would indicate\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"The train of reasoning is not very obscure, Watson,\" said Holmes with\\na mischievous twinkle.  \"It belongs to the same elementary class of\\ndeduction which I should illustrate if I were to ask you who shared\\nyour cab in your drive this morning.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t admit that a fresh illustration is an explanation,\" said I\\nwith some asperity.\\n\\n\"Bravo, Watson!  A very dignified and logical remonstrance.  Let me\\nsee, what were the points?  Take the last one first--the cab. You\\nobserve that you have some splashes on the left sleeve and shoulder of\\nyour coat.  Had you sat in the centre of a hansom you would probably\\nhave had no splashes, and if you had they would certainly have been\\nsymmetrical.  Therefore it is clear that you sat at the side.\\nTherefore it is equally clear that you had a companion.\"\\n\\n\"That is very evident.\"\\n\\n\"Absurdly commonplace, is it not?\"\\n\\n\"But the boots and the bath?\"\\n\\n\"Equally childish.  You are in the habit of doing up your boots in a\\ncertain way.  I see them on this occasion fastened with an elaborate\\ndouble bow, which is not your usual method of tying them.  You have,\\ntherefore, had them off.  Who has tied them?  A bootmaker--or the boy\\nat the bath.  It is unlikely that it is the bootmaker, since your boots\\nare nearly new.  Well, what remains? The bath.  Absurd, is it not?\\nBut, for all that, the Turkish bath has served a purpose.\"\\n\\n\"What is that?\"\\n\\n\"You say that you have had it because you need a change.  Let me\\nsuggest that you take one.  How would Lausanne do, my dear\\nWatson--first-class tickets and all expenses paid on a princely scale?\"\\n\\n\"Splendid!  But why?\"\\n\\nHolmes leaned back in his armchair and took his notebook from his\\npocket.\\n\\n\"One of the most dangerous classes in the world,\" said he, \"is the\\ndrifting and friendless woman.  She is the most harmless and often the\\nmost useful of mortals, but she is the inevitable inciter of crime in\\nothers.  She is helpless.  She is migratory. She has sufficient means\\nto take her from country to country and from hotel to hotel.  She is\\nlost, as often as not, in a maze of obscure pensions and\\nboardinghouses.  She is a stray chicken in a world of foxes.  When she\\nis gobbled up she is hardly missed. I much fear that some evil has come\\nto the Lady Frances Carfax.\"\\n\\nI was relieved at this sudden descent from the general to the\\nparticular.  Holmes consulted his notes.\\n\\n\"Lady Frances,\" he continued, \"is the sole survivor of the direct\\nfamily of the late Earl of Rufton.  The estates went, as you may\\nremember, in the male line.  She was left with limited means, but with\\nsome very remarkable old Spanish jewellery of silver and curiously cut\\ndiamonds to which she was fondly attached--too attached, for she\\nrefused to leave them with her banker and always carried them about\\nwith her.  A rather pathetic figure, the Lady Frances, a beautiful\\nwoman, still in fresh middle age, and yet, by a strange change, the\\nlast derelict of what only twenty years ago was a goodly fleet.\"\\n\\n\"What has happened to her, then?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, what has happened to the Lady Frances?  Is she alive or dead?\\nThere is our problem.  She is a lady of precise habits, and for four\\nyears it has been her invariable custom to write every second week to\\nMiss Dobney, her old governess, who has long retired and lives in\\nCamberwell. It is this Miss Dobney who has consulted me.  Nearly five\\nweeks have passed without a word.  The last letter was from the Hotel\\nNational at Lausanne. Lady Frances seems to have left there and given\\nno address.  The family are anxious, and as they are exceedingly\\nwealthy no sum will be spared if we can clear the matter up.\"\\n\\n\"Is Miss Dobney the only source of information?  Surely she had other\\ncorrespondents?\"\\n\\n\"There is one correspondent who is a sure draw, Watson.  That is the\\nbank.  Single ladies must live, and their passbooks are compressed\\ndiaries.  She banks at Silvester\\'s.  I have glanced over her account.\\nThe last check but one paid her bill at Lausanne, but it was a large\\none and probably left her with cash in hand.  Only one check has been\\ndrawn since.\"\\n\\n\"To whom, and where?\"\\n\\n\"To Miss Marie Devine.  There is nothing to show where the check was\\ndrawn.  It was cashed at the Credit Lyonnais at Montpellier less than\\nthree weeks ago.  The sum was fifty pounds.\"\\n\\n\"And who is Miss Marie Devine?\"\\n\\n\"That also I have been able to discover.  Miss Marie Devine was the\\nmaid of Lady Frances Carfax.  Why she should have paid her this check\\nwe have not yet determined. I have no doubt, however, that your\\nresearches will soon clear the matter up.\"\\n\\n\"MY researches!\"\\n\\n\"Hence the health-giving expedition to Lausanne.  You know that I\\ncannot possibly leave London while old Abrahams is in such mortal\\nterror of his life.  Besides, on general principles it is best that I\\nshould not leave the country.  Scotland Yard feels lonely without me,\\nand it causes an unhealthy excitement among the criminal classes.  Go,\\nthen, my dear Watson, and if my humble counsel can ever be valued at so\\nextravagant a rate as two pence a word, it waits your disposal night\\nand day at the end of the Continental wire.\"\\n\\nTwo days later found me at the Hotel National at Lausanne, where I\\nreceived every courtesy at the hands of M. Moser, the well-known\\nmanager.  Lady Frances, as he informed me, had stayed there for several\\nweeks.  She had been much liked by all who met her. Her age was not\\nmore than forty.  She was still handsome and bore every sign of having\\nin her youth been a very lovely woman.  M. Moser knew nothing of any\\nvaluable jewellery, but it had been remarked by the servants that the\\nheavy trunk in the lady\\'s bedroom was always scrupulously locked.\\nMarie Devine, the maid, was as popular as her mistress.  She was\\nactually engaged to one of the head waiters in the hotel, and there was\\nno difficulty in getting her address.  It was 11 Rue de Trajan,\\nMontpellier.  All this I jotted down and felt that Holmes himself could\\nnot have been more adroit in collecting his facts.\\n\\nOnly one corner still remained in the shadow.  No light which I\\npossessed could clear up the cause for the lady\\'s sudden departure.\\nShe was very happy at Lausanne.  There was every reason to believe that\\nshe intended to remain for the season in her luxurious rooms\\noverlooking the lake.  And yet she had left at a single day\\'s notice,\\nwhich involved her in the useless payment of a week\\'s rent.  Only Jules\\nVibart, the lover of the maid, had any suggestion to offer.  He\\nconnected the sudden departure with the visit to the hotel a day or two\\nbefore of a tall, dark, bearded man.  \"Un sauvage--un veritable\\nsauvage!\" cried Jules Vibart.  The man had rooms somewhere in the town.\\nHe had been seen talking earnestly to Madame on the promenade by the\\nlake.  Then he had called.  She had refused to see him.  He was\\nEnglish, but of his name there was no record.  Madame had left the\\nplace immediately afterwards.  Jules Vibart, and, what was of more\\nimportance, Jules Vibart\\'s sweetheart, thought that this call and the\\ndeparture were cause and effect.  Only one thing Jules would not\\ndiscuss.  That was the reason why Marie had left her mistress.  Of that\\nhe could or would say nothing.  If I wished to know, I must go to\\nMontpellier and ask her.\\n\\nSo ended the first chapter of my inquiry.  The second was devoted to\\nthe place which Lady Frances Carfax had sought when she left Lausanne.\\nConcerning this there had been some secrecy, which confirmed the idea\\nthat she had gone with the intention of throwing someone off her track.\\nOtherwise why should not her luggage have been openly labelled for\\nBaden?  Both she and it reached the Rhenish spa by some circuitous\\nroute.  This much I gathered from the manager of Cook\\'s local office.\\nSo to Baden I went, after dispatching to Holmes an account of all my\\nproceedings and receiving in reply a telegram of half-humorous\\ncommendation.\\n\\nAt Baden the track was not difficult to follow.  Lady Frances had\\nstayed at the Englischer Hof for a fortnight.  While there she had made\\nthe acquaintance of a Dr. Shlessinger and his wife, a missionary from\\nSouth America.  Like most lonely ladies, Lady Frances found her comfort\\nand occupation in religion.  Dr. Shlessinger\\'s remarkable personality,\\nhis whole hearted devotion, and the fact that he was recovering from a\\ndisease contracted in the exercise of his apostolic duties affected her\\ndeeply.  She had helped Mrs. Shlessinger in the nursing of the\\nconvalescent saint.  He spent his day, as the manager described it to\\nme, upon a lounge-chair on the veranda, with an attendant lady upon\\neither side of him.  He was preparing a map of the Holy Land, with\\nspecial reference to the kingdom of the Midianites, upon which he was\\nwriting a monograph.  Finally, having improved much in health, he and\\nhis wife had returned to London, and Lady Frances had started thither\\nin their company.  This was just three weeks before, and the manager\\nhad heard nothing since.  As to the maid, Marie, she had gone off some\\ndays beforehand in floods of tears, after informing the other maids\\nthat she was leaving service forever.  Dr. Shlessinger had paid the\\nbill of the whole party before his departure.\\n\\n\"By the way,\" said the landlord in conclusion, \"you are not the only\\nfriend of Lady Frances Carfax who is inquiring after her just now.\\nOnly a week or so ago we had a man here upon the same errand.\"\\n\\n\"Did he give a name?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"None; but he was an Englishman, though of an unusual type.\"\\n\\n\"A savage?\" said I, linking my facts after the fashion of my\\nillustrious friend.\\n\\n\"Exactly.  That describes him very well. He is a bulky, bearded,\\nsunburned fellow, who looks as if he would be more at home in a\\nfarmers\\' inn than in a fashionable hotel.  A hard, fierce man, I should\\nthink, and one whom I should be sorry to offend.\"\\n\\nAlready the mystery began to define itself, as figures grow clearer\\nwith the lifting of a fog.  Here was this good and pious lady pursued\\nfrom place to place by a sinister and unrelenting figure.  She feared\\nhim, or she would not have fled from Lausanne.  He had still followed.\\nSooner or later he would overtake her.  Had he already overtaken her?\\nWas THAT the secret of her continued silence?  Could the good people\\nwho were her companions not screen her from his violence or his\\nblackmail? What horrible purpose, what deep design, lay behind this\\nlong pursuit?  There was the problem which I had to solve.\\n\\nTo Holmes I wrote showing how rapidly and surely I had got down to the\\nroots of the matter.  In reply I had a telegram asking for a\\ndescription of Dr. Shlessinger\\'s left ear.  Holmes\\'s ideas of humour\\nare strange and occasionally offensive, so I took no notice of his\\nill-timed jest--indeed, I had already reached Montpellier in my pursuit\\nof the maid, Marie, before his message came.\\n\\nI had no difficulty in finding the ex-servant and in learning all that\\nshe could tell me.  She was a devoted creature, who had only left her\\nmistress because she was sure that she was in good hands, and because\\nher own approaching marriage made a separation inevitable in any case.\\nHer mistress had, as she confessed with distress, shown some\\nirritability of temper towards her during their stay in Baden, and had\\neven questioned her once as if she had suspicions of her honesty, and\\nthis had made the parting easier than it would otherwise have been.\\nLady Frances had given her fifty pounds as a wedding-present.  Like me,\\nMarie viewed with deep distrust the stranger who had driven her\\nmistress from Lausanne.  With her own eyes she had seen him seize the\\nlady\\'s wrist with great violence on the public promenade by the lake.\\nHe was a fierce and terrible man.  She believed that it was out of\\ndread of him that Lady Frances had accepted the escort of the\\nShlessingers to London.  She had never spoken to Marie about it, but\\nmany little signs had convinced the maid that her mistress lived in a\\nstate of continual nervous apprehension.  So far she had got in her\\nnarrative, when suddenly she sprang from her chair and her face was\\nconvulsed with surprise and fear.  \"See!\" she cried.  \"The miscreant\\nfollows still!  There is the very man of whom I speak.\"\\n\\nThrough the open sitting-room window I saw a huge, swarthy man with a\\nbristling black beard walking slowly down the centre of the street and\\nstaring eagerly at the numbers of the houses.  It was clear that, like\\nmyself, he was on the track of the maid. Acting upon the impulse of the\\nmoment, I rushed out and accosted him.\\n\\n\"You are an Englishman,\" I said.\\n\\n\"What if I am?\" he asked with a most villainous scowl.\\n\\n\"May I ask what your name is?\"\\n\\n\"No, you may not,\" said he with decision.\\n\\nThe situation was awkward, but the most direct way is often the best.\\n\\n\"Where is the Lady Frances Carfax?\" I asked.\\n\\nHe stared at me with amazement.\\n\\n\"What have you done with her?  Why have you pursued her?  I insist upon\\nan answer!\" said I.\\n\\nThe fellow gave a bellow of anger and sprang upon me like a tiger. I\\nhave held my own in many a struggle, but the man had a grip of iron and\\nthe fury of a fiend.  His hand was on my throat and my senses were\\nnearly gone before an unshaven French ouvrier in a blue blouse darted\\nout from a cabaret opposite, with a cudgel in his hand, and struck my\\nassailant a sharp crack over the forearm, which made him leave go his\\nhold.  He stood for an instant fuming with rage and uncertain whether\\nhe should not renew his attack. Then, with a snarl of anger, he left me\\nand entered the cottage from which I had just come.  I turned to thank\\nmy preserver, who stood beside me in the roadway.\\n\\n\"Well, Watson,\" said he, \"a very pretty hash you have made of it! I\\nrather think you had better come back with me to London by the night\\nexpress.\"\\n\\nAn hour afterwards, Sherlock Holmes, in his usual garb and style, was\\nseated in my private room at the hotel.  His explanation of his sudden\\nand opportune appearance was simplicity itself, for, finding that he\\ncould get away from London, he determined to head me off at the next\\nobvious point of my travels.  In the disguise of a workingman he had\\nsat in the cabaret waiting for my appearance.\\n\\n\"And a singularly consistent investigation you have made, my dear\\nWatson,\" said he.  \"I cannot at the moment recall any possible blunder\\nwhich you have omitted.  The total effect of your proceeding has been\\nto give the alarm everywhere and yet to discover nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you would have done no better,\" I answered bitterly.\\n\\n\"There is no \\'perhaps\\' about it.  I HAVE done better.  Here is the Hon.\\nPhilip Green, who is a fellow-lodger with you in this hotel, and we may\\nfind him the starting-point for a more successful investigation.\"\\n\\nA card had come up on a salver, and it was followed by the same bearded\\nruffian who had attacked me in the street.  He started when he saw me.\\n\\n\"What is this, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked.  \"I had your note and I have\\ncome.  But what has this man to do with the matter?\"\\n\\n\"This is my old friend and associate, Dr. Watson, who is helping us in\\nthis affair.\"\\n\\nThe stranger held out a huge, sunburned hand, with a few words of\\napology.\\n\\n\"I hope I didn\\'t harm you.  When you accused me of hurting her I lost\\nmy grip of myself.  Indeed, I\\'m not responsible in these days.  My\\nnerves are like live wires.  But this situation is beyond me.  What I\\nwant to know, in the first place, Mr. Holmes, is, how in the world you\\ncame to hear of my existence at all.\"\\n\\n\"I am in touch with Miss Dobney, Lady Frances\\'s governess.\"\\n\\n\"Old Susan Dobney with the mob cap!  I remember her well.\"\\n\\n\"And she remembers you.  It was in the days before--before you found it\\nbetter to go to South Africa.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, I see you know my whole story.  I need hide nothing from you.  I\\nswear to you, Mr. Holmes, that there never was in this world a man who\\nloved a woman with a more wholehearted love than I had for Frances.  I\\nwas a wild youngster, I know--not worse than others of my class.  But\\nher mind was pure as snow.  She could not bear a shadow of coarseness.\\nSo, when she came to hear of things that I had done, she would have no\\nmore to say to me. And yet she loved me--that is the wonder of\\nit!--loved me well enough to remain single all her sainted days just\\nfor my sake alone.  When the years had passed and I had made my money\\nat Barberton I thought perhaps I could seek her out and soften her. I\\nhad heard that she was still unmarried, I found her at Lausanne and\\ntried all I knew.  She weakened, I think, but her will was strong, and\\nwhen next I called she had left the town.  I traced her to Baden, and\\nthen after a time heard that her maid was here. I\\'m a rough fellow,\\nfresh from a rough life, and when Dr. Watson spoke to me as he did I\\nlost hold of myself for a moment.  But for God\\'s sake tell me what has\\nbecome of the Lady Frances.\"\\n\\n\"That is for us to find out,\" said Sherlock Holmes with peculiar\\ngravity.  \"What is your London address, Mr. Green?\"\\n\\n\"The Langham Hotel will find me.\"\\n\\n\"Then may I recommend that you return there and be on hand in case I\\nshould want you?  I have no desire to encourage false hopes, but you\\nmay rest assured that all that can be done will be done for the safety\\nof Lady Frances.  I can say no more for the instant.  I will leave you\\nthis card so that you may be able to keep in touch with us.  Now,\\nWatson, if you will pack your bag I will cable to Mrs. Hudson to make\\none of her best efforts for two hungry travellers at 7:30 to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\\nA telegram was awaiting us when we reached our Baker Street rooms,\\nwhich Holmes read with an exclamation of interest and threw across to\\nme.  \"Jagged or torn,\" was the message, and the place of origin, Baden.\\n\\n\"What is this?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"It is everything,\" Holmes answered.  \"You may remember my seemingly\\nirrelevant question as to this clerical gentleman\\'s left ear. You did\\nnot answer it.\"\\n\\n\"I had left Baden and could not inquire.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly.  For this reason I sent a duplicate to the manager of the\\nEnglischer Hof, whose answer lies here.\"\\n\\n\"What does it show?\"\\n\\n\"It shows, my dear Watson, that we are dealing with an exceptionally\\nastute and dangerous man.  The Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, missionary from\\nSouth America, is none other than Holy Peters, one of the most\\nunscrupulous rascals that Australia has ever evolved--and for a young\\ncountry it has turned out some very finished types.  His particular\\nspecialty is the beguiling of lonely ladies by playing upon their\\nreligious feelings, and his so-called wife, an Englishwoman named\\nFraser, is a worthy helpmate.  The nature of his tactics suggested his\\nidentity to me, and this physical peculiarity--he was badly bitten in a\\nsaloon-fight at Adelaide in \\'89--confirmed my suspicion.  This poor\\nlady is in the hands of a most infernal couple, who will stick at\\nnothing, Watson.  That she is already dead is a very likely\\nsupposition.  If not, she is undoubtedly in some sort of confinement\\nand unable to write to Miss Dobney or her other friends.  It is always\\npossible that she never reached London, or that she has passed through\\nit, but the former is improbable, as, with their system of\\nregistration, it is not easy for foreigners to play tricks with the\\nContinental police; and the latter is also unlikely, as these rouges\\ncould not hope to find any other place where it would be as easy to\\nkeep a person under restraint. All my instincts tell me that she is in\\nLondon, but as we have at present no possible means of telling where,\\nwe can only take the obvious steps, eat our dinner, and possess our\\nsouls in patience. Later in the evening I will stroll down and have a\\nword with friend Lestrade at Scotland Yard.\"\\n\\nBut neither the official police nor Holmes\\'s own small but very\\nefficient organization sufficed to clear away the mystery.  Amid the\\ncrowded millions of London the three persons we sought were as\\ncompletely obliterated as if they had never lived. Advertisements were\\ntried, and failed.  Clues were followed, and led to nothing.  Every\\ncriminal resort which Shlessinger might frequent was drawn in vain.\\nHis old associates were watched, but they kept clear of him.  And then\\nsuddenly, after a week of helpless suspense there came a flash of\\nlight.  A silver-and-brilliant pendant of old Spanish design had been\\npawned at Bovington\\'s, in Westminster Road.  The pawner was a large,\\nclean-shaven man of clerical appearance.  His name and address were\\ndemonstrably false.  The ear had escaped notice, but the description\\nwas surely that of Shlessinger.\\n\\nThree times had our bearded friend from the Langham called for\\nnews--the third time within an hour of this fresh development. His\\nclothes were getting looser on his great body.  He seemed to be wilting\\naway in his anxiety.  \"If you will only give me something to do!\" was\\nhis constant wail.  At last Holmes could oblige him.\\n\\n\"He has begun to pawn the jewels.  We should get him now.\"\\n\\n\"But does this mean that any harm has befallen the Lady Frances?\"\\n\\nHolmes shook his head very gravely.\\n\\n\"Supposing that they have held her prisoner up to now, it is clear that\\nthey cannot let her loose without their own destruction.  We must\\nprepare for the worst.\"\\n\\n\"What can I do?\"\\n\\n\"These people do not know you by sight?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"It is possible that he will go to some other pawnbroker in the future.\\nIn that case, we must begin again.  On the other hand, he has had a\\nfair price and no questions asked, so if he is in need of ready-money\\nhe will probably come back to Bovington\\'s.  I will give you a note to\\nthem, and they will let you wait in the shop.  If the fellow comes you\\nwill follow him home.  But no indiscretion, and, above all, no\\nviolence.  I put you on your honour that you will take no step without\\nmy knowledge and consent.\"\\n\\nFor two days the Hon. Philip Green (he was, I may mention, the son of\\nthe famous admiral of that name who commanded the Sea of Azof fleet in\\nthe Crimean War) brought us no news.  On the evening of the third he\\nrushed into our sitting-room, pale, trembling, with every muscle of his\\npowerful frame quivering with excitement.\\n\\n\"We have him!  We have him!\" he cried.\\n\\nHe was incoherent in his agitation.  Holmes soothed him with a few\\nwords and thrust him into an armchair.\\n\\n\"Come, now, give us the order of events,\" said he.\\n\\n\"She came only an hour ago.  It was the wife, this time, but the\\npendant she brought was the fellow of the other.  She is a tall, pale\\nwoman, with ferret eyes.\"\\n\\n\"That is the lady,\" said Holmes.\\n\\n\"She left the office and I followed her.  She walked up the Kennington\\nRoad, and I kept behind her.  Presently she went into a shop.  Mr.\\nHolmes, it was an undertaker\\'s.\"\\n\\nMy companion started.  \"Well?\" he asked in that vibrant voice which\\ntold of the fiery soul behind the cold gray face.\\n\\n\"She was talking to the woman behind the counter. I entered as well.\\n\\'It is late,\\' I heard her say, or words to that effect. The woman was\\nexcusing herself.  \\'It should be there before now,\\' she answered.  \\'It\\ntook longer, being out of the ordinary.\\'  They both stopped and looked\\nat me, so I asked some questions and then left the shop.\"\\n\\n\"You did excellently well.  What happened next?\"\\n\\n\"The woman came out, but I had hid myself in a doorway.  Her suspicions\\nhad been aroused, I think, for she looked round her. Then she called a\\ncab and got in.  I was lucky enough to get another and so to follow\\nher.  She got down at last at No. 36, Poultney Square, Brixton.  I\\ndrove past, left my cab at the corner of the square, and watched the\\nhouse.\"\\n\\n\"Did you see anyone?\"\\n\\n\"The windows were all in darkness save one on the lower floor. The\\nblind was down, and I could not see in.  I was standing there,\\nwondering what I should do next, when a covered van drove up with two\\nmen in it.  They descended, took something out of the van, and carried\\nit up the steps to the hall door.  Mr. Holmes, it was a coffin.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\"\\n\\n\"For an instant I was on the point of rushing in.  The door had been\\nopened to admit the men and their burden. It was the woman who had\\nopened it.  But as I stood there she caught a glimpse of me, and I\\nthink that she recognized me.  I saw her start, and she hastily closed\\nthe door. I remembered my promise to you, and here I am.\"\\n\\n\"You have done excellent work,\" said Holmes, scribbling a few words\\nupon a half-sheet of paper.  \"We can do nothing legal without a\\nwarrant, and you can serve the cause best by taking this note down to\\nthe authorities and getting one.  There may be some difficulty, but I\\nshould think that the sale of the jewellery should be sufficient.\\nLestrade will see to all details.\"\\n\\n\"But they may murder her in the meanwhile.  What could the coffin mean,\\nand for whom could it be but for her?\"\\n\\n\"We will do all that can be done, Mr. Green.  Not a moment will be\\nlost.  Leave it in our hands.  Now Watson,\" he added as our client\\nhurried away, \"he will set the regular forces on the move. We are, as\\nusual, the irregulars, and we must take our own line of action.  The\\nsituation strikes me as so desperate that the most extreme measures are\\njustified.  Not a moment is to be lost in getting to Poultney Square.\\n\\n\"Let us try to reconstruct the situation,\" said he as we drove swiftly\\npast the Houses of Parliament and over Westminster Bridge.  \"These\\nvillains have coaxed this unhappy lady to London, after first\\nalienating her from her faithful maid.  If she has written any letters\\nthey have been intercepted.  Through some confederate they have engaged\\na furnished house.  Once inside it, they have made her a prisoner, and\\nthey have become possessed of the valuable jewellery which has been\\ntheir object from the first.  Already they have begun to sell part of\\nit, which seems safe enough to them, since they have no reason to think\\nthat anyone is interested in the lady\\'s fate.  When she is released she\\nwill, of course, denounce them.  Therefore, she must not be released.\\nBut they cannot keep her under lock and key forever. So murder is their\\nonly solution.\"\\n\\n\"That seems very clear.\"\\n\\n\"Now we will take another line of reasoning.  When you follow two\\nseparate chains of thought, Watson, you will find some point of\\nintersection which should approximate to the truth.  We will start now,\\nnot from the lady but from the coffin and argue backward.  That\\nincident proves, I fear, beyond all doubt that the lady is dead.  It\\npoints also to an orthodox burial with proper accompaniment of medical\\ncertificate and official sanction.  Had the lady been obviously\\nmurdered, they would have buried her in a hole in the back garden.  But\\nhere all is open and regular.  What does this mean?  Surely that they\\nhave done her to death in some way which has deceived the doctor and\\nsimulated a natural end--poisoning, perhaps.  And yet how strange that\\nthey should ever let a doctor approach her unless he were a\\nconfederate, which is hardly a credible proposition.\"\\n\\n\"Could they have forged a medical certificate?\"\\n\\n\"Dangerous, Watson, very dangerous.  No, I hardly see them doing that.\\nPull up, cabby!  This is evidently the undertaker\\'s, for we have just\\npassed the pawnbroker\\'s.  Would you go in, Watson?  Your appearance\\ninspires confidence.  Ask what hour the Poultney Square funeral takes\\nplace to-morrow.\"\\n\\nThe woman in the shop answered me without hesitation that it was to be\\nat eight o\\'clock in the morning.  \"You see, Watson, no mystery;\\neverything above-board!  In some way the legal forms have undoubtedly\\nbeen complied with, and they think that they have little to fear.\\nWell, there\\'s nothing for it now but a direct frontal attack.  Are you\\narmed?\"\\n\\n\"My stick!\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, we shall be strong enough.  \\'Thrice is he armed who hath\\nhis quarrel just.\\'  We simply can\\'t afford to wait for the police or to\\nkeep within the four corners of the law.  You can drive off, cabby.\\nNow, Watson, we\\'ll just take our luck together, as we have occasionally\\nin the past.\"\\n\\nHe had rung loudly at the door of a great dark house in the centre of\\nPoultney Square.  It was opened immediately, and the figure of a tall\\nwoman was outlined against the dim-lit hall.\\n\\n\"Well, what do you want?\" she asked sharply, peering at us through the\\ndarkness.\\n\\n\"I want to speak to Dr. Shlessinger,\" said Holmes.\\n\\n\"There is no such person here,\" she answered, and tried to close the\\ndoor, but Holmes had jammed it with his foot.\\n\\n\"Well, I want to see the man who lives here, whatever he may call\\nhimself,\" said Holmes firmly.\\n\\nShe hesitated.  Then she threw open the door.  \"Well, come in!\" said\\nshe.  \"My husband is not afraid to face any man in the world.\"  She\\nclosed the door behind us and showed us into a sitting-room on the\\nright side of the hall, turning up the gas as she left us.  \"Mr. Peters\\nwill be with you in an instant,\" she said.\\n\\nHer words were literally true, for we had hardly time to look around\\nthe dusty and moth-eaten apartment in which we found ourselves before\\nthe door opened and a big, clean-shaven bald-headed man stepped lightly\\ninto the room.  He had a large red face, with pendulous cheeks, and a\\ngeneral air of superficial benevolence which was marred by a cruel,\\nvicious mouth.\\n\\n\"There is surely some mistake here, gentlemen,\" he said in an unctuous,\\nmake-everything-easy voice.  \"I fancy that you have been misdirected.\\nPossibly if you tried farther down the street--\"\\n\\n\"That will do; we have no time to waste,\" said my companion firmly.\\n\"You are Henry Peters, of Adelaide, late the Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, of\\nBaden and South America.  I am as sure of that as that my own name is\\nSherlock Holmes.\"\\n\\nPeters, as I will now call him, started and stared hard at his\\nformidable pursuer.  \"I guess your name does not frighten me, Mr.\\nHolmes,\" said he coolly.  \"When a man\\'s conscience is easy you can\\'t\\nrattle him.  What is your business in my house?\"\\n\\n\"I want to know what you have done with the Lady Frances Carfax, whom\\nyou brought away with you from Baden.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d be very glad if you could tell me where that lady may be,\" Peters\\nanswered coolly.  \"I\\'ve a bill against her for nearly a hundred\\npounds, and nothing to show for it but a couple of trumpery pendants\\nthat the dealer would hardly look at.  She attached herself to Mrs.\\nPeters and me at Baden--it is a fact that I was using another name at\\nthe time--and she stuck on to us until we came to London.  I paid her\\nbill and her ticket.  Once in London, she gave us the slip, and, as I\\nsay, left these out-of-date jewels to pay her bills.  You find her, Mr.\\nHolmes, and I\\'m your debtor.\"\\n\\n\"I MEAN to find her,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"I\\'m going through this\\nhouse till I do find her.\"\\n\\n\"Where is your warrant?\"\\n\\nHolmes half drew a revolver from his pocket.  \"This will have to serve\\ntill a better one comes.\"\\n\\n\"Why, you\\'re a common burglar.\"\\n\\n\"So you might describe me,\" said Holmes cheerfully.  \"My companion is\\nalso a dangerous ruffian.  And together we are going through your\\nhouse.\"\\n\\nOur opponent opened the door.\\n\\n\"Fetch a policeman, Annie!\" said he.  There was a whisk of feminine\\nskirts down the passage, and the hall door was opened and shut.\\n\\n\"Our time is limited, Watson,\" said Holmes.  \"If you try to stop us,\\nPeters, you will most certainly get hurt.  Where is that coffin which\\nwas brought into your house?\"\\n\\n\"What do you want with the coffin?  It is in use.  There is a body in\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"I must see the body.\"\\n\\n\"Never with my consent.\"\\n\\n\"Then without it.\"  With a quick movement Holmes pushed the fellow to\\none side and passed into the hall.  A door half opened stood\\nimmediately before us.  We entered.  It was the dining-room. On the\\ntable, under a half-lit chandelier, the coffin was lying.  Holmes\\nturned up the gas and raised the lid.  Deep down in the recesses of the\\ncoffin lay an emaciated figure.  The glare from the lights above beat\\ndown upon an aged and withered face. By no possible process of cruelty,\\nstarvation, or disease could this worn-out wreck be the still beautiful\\nLady Frances.  Holmes\\'s face showed his amazement, and also his relief.\\n\\n\"Thank God!\" he muttered.  \"It\\'s someone else.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, you\\'ve blundered badly for once, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said\\nPeters, who had followed us into the room.\\n\\n\"Who is the dead woman?\"\\n\\n\"Well, if you really must know, she is an old nurse of my wife\\'s, Rose\\nSpender by name, whom we found in the Brixton Workhouse Infirmary.  We\\nbrought her round here, called in Dr. Horsom, of 13 Firbank\\nVillas--mind you take the address, Mr. Holmes--and had her carefully\\ntended, as Christian folk should.  On the third day she\\ndied--certificate says senile decay--but that\\'s only the doctor\\'s\\nopinion, and of course you know better.  We ordered her funeral to be\\ncarried out by Stimson and Co., of the Kennington Road, who will bury\\nher at eight o\\'clock to-morrow morning.  Can you pick any hole in that,\\nMr. Holmes?  You\\'ve made a silly blunder, and you may as well own up to\\nit.  I\\'d give something for a photograph of your gaping, staring face\\nwhen you pulled aside that lid expecting to see the Lady Frances Carfax\\nand only found a poor old woman of ninety.\"\\n\\nHolmes\\'s expression was as impassive as ever under the jeers of his\\nantagonist, but his clenched hands betrayed his acute annoyance.\\n\\n\"I am going through your house,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Are you, though!\" cried Peters as a woman\\'s voice and heavy steps\\nsounded in the passage.  \"We\\'ll soon see about that.  This way,\\nofficers, if you please.  These men have forced their way into my\\nhouse, and I cannot get rid of them.  Help me to put them out.\"\\n\\nA sergeant and a constable stood in the doorway.  Holmes drew his card\\nfrom his case.\\n\\n\"This is my name and address.  This is my friend, Dr. Watson.\"\\n\\n\"Bless you, sir, we know you very well,\" said the sergeant, \"but you\\ncan\\'t stay here without a warrant.\"\\n\\n\"Of course not.  I quite understand that.\"\\n\\n\"Arrest him!\" cried Peters.\\n\\n\"We know where to lay our hands on this gentleman if he is wanted,\"\\nsaid the sergeant majestically, \"but you\\'ll have to go, Mr. Holmes.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Watson, we shall have to go.\"\\n\\nA minute later we were in the street once more.  Holmes was as cool as\\never, but I was hot with anger and humiliation.  The sergeant had\\nfollowed us.\\n\\n\"Sorry, Mr. Holmes, but that\\'s the law.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly, Sergeant, you could not do otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"I expect there was good reason for your presence there.  If there is\\nanything I can do--\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a missing lady, Sergeant, and we think she is in that house.  I\\nexpect a warrant presently.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll keep my eye on the parties, Mr. Holmes.  If anything comes\\nalong, I will surely let you know.\"\\n\\nIt was only nine o\\'clock, and we were off full cry upon the trail at\\nonce.  First we drove to Brixton Workhouse Infirmary, where we found\\nthat it was indeed the truth that a charitable couple had called some\\ndays before, that they had claimed an imbecile old woman as a former\\nservant, and that they had obtained permission to take her away with\\nthem.  No surprise was expressed at the news that she had since died.\\n\\nThe doctor was our next goal.  He had been called in, had found the\\nwoman dying of pure senility, had actually seen her pass away, and had\\nsigned the certificate in due form.  \"I assure you that everything was\\nperfectly normal and there was no room for foul play in the matter,\"\\nsaid he. Nothing in the house had struck him as suspicious save that\\nfor people of their class it was remarkable that they should have no\\nservant.  So far and no further went the doctor.\\n\\nFinally we found our way to Scotland Yard.  There had been difficulties\\nof procedure in regard to the warrant.  Some delay was inevitable.  The\\nmagistrate\\'s signature might not be obtained until next morning.  If\\nHolmes would call about nine he could go down with Lestrade and see it\\nacted upon.  So ended the day, save that near midnight our friend, the\\nsergeant, called to say that he had seen flickering lights here and\\nthere in the windows of the great dark house, but that no one had left\\nit and none had entered.  We could but pray for patience and wait for\\nthe morrow.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes was too irritable for conversation and too restless for\\nsleep.  I left him smoking hard, with his heavy, dark brows knotted\\ntogether, and his long, nervous fingers tapping upon the arms of his\\nchair, as he turned over in his mind every possible solution of the\\nmystery.  Several times in the course of the night I heard him prowling\\nabout the house. Finally, just after I had been called in the morning,\\nhe rushed into my room.  He was in his dressing-gown, but his pale,\\nhollow-eyed face told me that his night had been a sleepless one.\\n\\n\"What time was the funeral?  Eight, was it not?\" he asked eagerly.\\n\"Well, it is 7:20 now.  Good heavens, Watson, what has become of any\\nbrains that God has given me?  Quick, man, quick! It\\'s life or death--a\\nhundred chances on death to one on life. I\\'ll never forgive myself,\\nnever, if we are too late!\"\\n\\nFive minutes had not passed before we were flying in a hansom down\\nBaker Street.  But even so it was twenty-five to eight as we passed Big\\nBen, and eight struck as we tore down the Brixton Road.  But others\\nwere late as well as we.  Ten minutes after the hour the hearse was\\nstill standing at the door of the house, and even as our foaming horse\\ncame to a halt the coffin, supported by three men, appeared on the\\nthreshold.  Holmes darted forward and barred their way.\\n\\n\"Take it back!\" he cried, laying his hand on the breast of the\\nforemost.  \"Take it back this instant!\"\\n\\n\"What the devil do you mean?  Once again I ask you, where is your\\nwarrant?\" shouted the furious Peters, his big red face glaring over the\\nfarther end of the coffin.\\n\\n\"The warrant is on its way.  The coffin shall remain in the house until\\nit comes.\"\\n\\nThe authority in Holmes\\'s voice had its effect upon the bearers. Peters\\nhad suddenly vanished into the house, and they obeyed these new orders.\\n\"Quick, Watson, quick!  Here is a screw-driver!\" he shouted as the\\ncoffin was replaced upon the table. \"Here\\'s one for you, my man!  A\\nsovereign if the lid comes off in a minute!  Ask no questions--work\\naway!  That\\'s good!  Another! And another!  Now pull all together!\\nIt\\'s giving!  It\\'s giving! Ah, that does it at last.\"\\n\\nWith a united effort we tore off the coffin-lid.  As we did so there\\ncame from the inside a stupefying and overpowering smell of chloroform.\\nA body lay within, its head all wreathed in cotton-wool, which had been\\nsoaked in the narcotic.  Holmes plucked it off and disclosed the\\nstatuesque face of a handsome and spiritual woman of middle age.  In an\\ninstant he had passed his arm round the figure and raised her to a\\nsitting position.\\n\\n\"Is she gone, Watson?  Is there a spark left?  Surely we are not too\\nlate!\"\\n\\nFor half an hour it seemed that we were.  What with actual suffocation,\\nand what with the poisonous fumes of the chloroform, the Lady Frances\\nseemed to have passed the last point of recall. And then, at last, with\\nartificial respiration, with injected ether, and with every device that\\nscience could suggest, some flutter of life, some quiver of the\\neyelids, some dimming of a mirror, spoke of the slowly returning life.\\nA cab had driven up, and Holmes, parting the blind, looked out at it.\\n\"Here is Lestrade with his warrant,\" said he.  \"He will find that his\\nbirds have flown.  And here,\" he added as a heavy step hurried along\\nthe passage, \"is someone who has a better right to nurse this lady than\\nwe have.  Good morning, Mr. Green; I think that the sooner we can move\\nthe Lady Frances the better. Meanwhile, the funeral may proceed, and\\nthe poor old woman who still lies in that coffin may go to her last\\nresting-place alone.\"\\n\\n\"Should you care to add the case to your annals, my dear Watson,\" said\\nHolmes that evening, \"it can only be as an example of that temporary\\neclipse to which even the best-balanced mind may be exposed.  Such\\nslips are common to all mortals, and the greatest is he who can\\nrecognize and repair them.  To this modified credit I may, perhaps,\\nmake some claim.  My night was haunted by the thought that somewhere a\\nclue, a strange sentence, a curious observation, had come under my\\nnotice and had been too easily dismissed.  Then, suddenly, in the gray\\nof the morning, the words came back to me.  It was the remark of the\\nundertaker\\'s wife, as reported by Philip Green.  She had said, \\'It\\nshould be there before now.  It took longer, being out of the\\nordinary.\\'  It was the coffin of which she spoke.  It had been out of\\nthe ordinary. That could only mean that it had been made to some\\nspecial measurement.  But why?  Why?  Then in an instant I remembered\\nthe deep sides, and the little wasted figure at the bottom.  Why so\\nlarge a coffin for so small a body?  To leave room for another body.\\nBoth would be buried under the one certificate.  It had all been so\\nclear, if only my own sight had not been dimmed.  At eight the Lady\\nFrances would be buried.  Our one chance was to stop the coffin before\\nit left the house.\\n\\n\"It was a desperate chance that we might find her alive, but it WAS a\\nchance, as the result showed.  These people had never, to my knowledge,\\ndone a murder.  They might shrink from actual violence at the last.\\nThe could bury her with no sign of how she met her end, and even if she\\nwere exhumed there was a chance for them.  I hoped that such\\nconsiderations might prevail with them. You can reconstruct the scene\\nwell enough.  You saw the horrible den upstairs, where the poor lady\\nhad been kept so long.  They rushed in and overpowered her with their\\nchloroform, carried her down, poured more into the coffin to insure\\nagainst her waking, and then screwed down the lid.  A clever device,\\nWatson.  It is new to me in the annals of crime.  If our ex-missionary\\nfriends escape the clutches of Lestrade, I shall expect to hear of some\\nbrilliant incidents in their future career.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Disappearance of Lady Frances\\nCarfax, by Arthur Conan Doyle\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DISAPPEARANCE OF LADY CARFAX ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 2348.txt or 2348.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/4/2348/\\n\\nProduced by David Brannan.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\nFoundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official\\npage at https://pglaf.org\\n\\nFor additional contact information:\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n'"
